# Regularization in Regression Models using the Diabetes Dataset

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive guide to applying regularization techniques in regression models, specifically focused on the diabetes dataset. Regularization methods are crucial in preventing overfitting by penalizing large coefficients. In this notebook, we explore two main types of regularization: L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, and compare their effects on a regression model's performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook is the widely known diabetes dataset. It contains ten baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements for 442 patients. The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

## Objectives
- To understand the concept of regularization in regression models.
- To apply L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques on the diabetes dataset.
- To compare the performance of regression models with and without regularization.
- To analyze the impact of regularization on model coefficients and interpret the results.
